Line 27: normal chr1 read

Line 28: unmapped chr2 read (shouldn't exist given assignmnent prompt, but wanted to be sure it wouldn't cause issues)

Line 29: normal chr3 read with realistic CIGAR(no soft-clipping)

Line 30: normal chr3 read with realistic CIGAR(no soft-clipping)

Line 31: normal chr3 read with simple CIGAR

Line 32: negative strand chr3 read with simple CIGAR

Line 33: negative strand chr3 read with same UMI and given starting position as Line 32, but includes a CIGAR with soft-clipping;
since the soft-clipping alters the true starting position, this is not a PCR duplicate and thus appears in the output file

Line 34: simple PCR duplicate of Line 31 (no soft-clipping) - not present in output file

Line 35: normal chr4 read

Line 36: complex PCR duplicate of Line 35; has same UMI but different starting position from Line 35, but the soft-clipping in the CIGAR string
makes this read a duplicate that is thus filtered from the output file

Line 37: chr4 read with unknown UMI - not in output file

Line 38: normal chr5 read

Line 39: chr5 read with unknown UMI - filtered out of output file

Line 40: normal chr6 read
